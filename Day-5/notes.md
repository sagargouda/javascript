1. Deafult parameters = some parameters are set by deafult

2) deafult values can contain any value

// How passing arguments works (value vs refrence)
=> in notes explained

3.primitive types are stored in call stack where execution context is present and objects are stored in heap

4. so idenetifier or variable points to address not value itself ,

5) we pass a refernce to the function and not by the funciton in js

6) In JavaScript, when you pass an object (which includes arrays and functions) to a function, you are passing a reference to that object, not a copy of the object. This means that changes made to the object inside the function will affect the original object outside the function.

However, when you pass a primitive value (like a number, string, boolean, etc.) to a function, you are passing a copy of that value, and changes made to the value inside the function do not affect the original outside the function.

7.First class and higher order functions. 8) as fucntions are type of objets they also has methods like array like bind , call , apply
