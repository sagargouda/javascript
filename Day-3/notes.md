1.JAVASCRIPT IS A HIGH-LEVEL, PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED,MULTI-PARADIGM, INTERPRETED OR JUST-IN-TIME COMPILED,DYNAMIC, SINGLE-THREADED, GARBAGE-COLLECTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WITH FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS AND A NON-BLOCKING
EVENT LOOP CONCURRENCY MODEL

2. High-level = in low level language they need to manage resources like memory , js don't have to do it but low level languages are fast

3) garbage collection = it is an algorithm in js engine which automatically removes unused objects

4) Interpreted or Just in time = we write human readble code which is an abstraction oover machine code , which inddeed converted to machine code .

5) multi-paradigm :- mindeset of structuring code , which will direct coding style a) procedural b) oops c) fucntional

6) prototype based object-oriented :- almost eveyrthing in js is object except primitve values , arrays are just objects

7) first class funcitons = we can pass funcitons inside funcitons they are treated as regular variables

8) dynamic = loosely typed , we don't assign any data typer

9) single -threded , non-blocking event loop = how js engine handles multiple tasks happening at same time , we need it bcz js runs in one single thread , so it can do one thing at a time

//////////////////////////////////////////////

Javascript engine and runtime

1. Js engine is a program that executes js code ,
   js engine has call stack and heap

2) call stack is where our code is excuted and heap is where objects are stored
